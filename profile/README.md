## Ion Motion Control

So, the actual Company closed down, and I had some of their products.
So I created this to help other people in the same situation figure things out.
I have documentation on how to use the products, libraries, and example code.

<summary>Disclaimer</summary><br>
The company did rebrand to <a href="https://www.basicmicro.com/" target="_blank">BasicMicro</a>, but <a href="https://github.com/basicmicro" target="_blank">their github</a> has been dead since 2019.
So I decided to open this, to keep it more up-to-date.
